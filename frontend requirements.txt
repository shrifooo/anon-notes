📐 UI Elements
Element	Style/Notes

🧰 2. Suggested Frontend Frameworks
Goal	Framework
Quick prototyping	Tailwind CSS + HTML
Component library	ShadCN/UI (based on Radix UI + Tailwind)
Full frontend flexibility	React.js
Design-to-code feel	Next.js (if you go advanced later)
Minimal UI-only approach	Streamlit (if keeping everything in Python)

💡 If you're using Flask for backend, you can pair them with:

    Tailwind CSS + basic HTML templates

    or plug in React frontend via a separate project folder (slightly more setup, but worth it)

📋 3. Requirements for Frontend UI

Here's how you'd describe your frontend expectations clearly to the AI or another dev:
💌 Home Page — “Leave or Receive a Note”
Section	Description
Header	App name in a cute font + gentle background gradient
CTA Buttons	Two pastel buttons: “Leave a note” and “Receive a note”
Illustration	Soft animated SVG or Lottie animation — like a floating envelope or heart
Footer	Link to “About” page + small tagline like “Spreading good vibes ✨”
✍️ Leave a Note Page
Element	Description
Textarea	Big rounded corner input box with placeholder “Write something kind…”
Mood selector	Optional dropdown or emoji to tag mood of the note (e.g., 💖, 🌈, 🌻)
Submit Button	Cute, animated on hover — pastel color, says “Send this note 💌”
Success message	“Your note is now floating in the kindness universe 🌟”
📬 Receive a Note Page
Element	Description
Card	Centered soft-glow card with a single anonymous note
Refresh button	“Give me another note 🔄” — soft bounce on click
Background	Maybe an animated sky with drifting clouds or stars
